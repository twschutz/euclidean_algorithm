## What is the Euclidean Algorithm
The Euclidean Algorithm is used to quickly compute the greatest common divisor of two integers.\
For the purpose of simplicity, I have made this program work only with non-negative integers.\
The Euclidean Algorithm finishes when it finds a number that both integers are divisible by\
with a remainder of zero.
### The Euclidean Algorithm in Action
Find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 351 and 135
  1. gcd(351, 135) = 351 - 2 * 135 + 81
  2. gcd(135, 81) = 135 - 1 * 81 + 54
  3. gcd(81, 54) = 81 - 1 * 54 + 27
  4. gcd(54, 27) = 54 - 2 * 27 + 0
Since the remainder in step 4 is zero, the greatest common divisor of 351 and 135 is 27!
